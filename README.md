<h1>ZephyrJS</h1>
<p><b>Expands PixiJS for easy game development!</b></p>
<h2>Tell Me Why</h2>
<p>PixiJS on its own is very powerful, but a lot of work is needed to make it work for web-based games. PhaserIO is exclusively used to make games, and not all of the functionality is easily translatable back to Pixi. ZephyrJS directly ADDS to Pixi instead of wrapping it, letting you use the full functionality of Pixi so that the work is translatable.</p>
<h2>Download & Get Started!</h2>
<p>Just by including the following lines (order matters):</p>
<p><code>&lt;script src="https&#58;//pixijs.download/release/pixi.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code><br/><code>&lt;script src="https://ottcs.github.io/ZephyrJS/dev/zepyhr.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></p>
<p>all of the functionality of PixiJS and Zephyr have been added, through Content Delivery Networks.</p>
<p><b>NOTE: </b>If you're looking to release a stable version of your game, or if development is taking place over a span of time, using the CDNs aren't the best option (as specs and functionality can change). Download stable versions of both Zephyr and Pixi through the Github Releases, then include the script tags above with the path to the files as the src attribute.</p>

<p>Also, I'd love it if you have an idea for some functionality! Start an issue report or discussion, or make a WELL DOCUMENTED pull request and I can include you in further development!</p>
